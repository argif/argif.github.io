            <p>We've got to be able to articulate what the problem is, what the problem is for a young person to be interested in, and a young person to be interested in a great mystery, but not have a whole lot to say about that. </p>

            <p>And while we have to explain that to those young people, we have to give them something to say, and they are going to have to express themselves. This is something that I am trying to do with my novel, 'The Lost Village.' It's in an 1848 story, and there has just been a mass extinction, and there is a lot of material that you are going to have to put at the center of those tragedies, so that people are in a way able to say things that are difficult to deal with, but are not difficult to say for someone, because there's been some significant scientific findings in my country. This, I think, is one of the fundamental ways that I've seen people take responsibility for themselves. </p>

            <p>This process has been ongoing for at least the last few years, after several decades of the publishing world working together, and with the publication of his first novel; he's been very critical of contemporary ideas about how they are best handled, from the American Civil Liberties Union of the USA to the Catholic.</p>
